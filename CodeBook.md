Description of Variables:

subject		- Integer indentifying a unique individual
group		- String indicating whether the subject was part of the training or the experimental group
activity	- String indicating the activity the subject was performing 
			  (standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking downstairs, or walking upstairs)

The following list contains the variables recorded during the experiment 

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The recording device is either the accelerometer (Acc) or the gyroscope (Gyro).
't' indicates a time signal, 'f' indicates a frequency signal
Acc is split by source, either 'gravity' or 'body'
XYZ indicates the axis that recorded the value, Mag is the magnitude of the signal (combined axises)
Reported for each variable is the mean and standard deviation (std).
There are 66 resulting variables in the dataset.
